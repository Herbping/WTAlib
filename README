There are several handy bash scripts for running QSyGuS
1) test_ESolver: automatically run all passed benchmarks described in the paper with ESolver
	
2) test_CVC4: automatically run all passed benchmarks described in the paper with CVC4

3) benchmark_detai: introduce how benchmarks were created

4) test [SolverName] [benchmark] : can solve consumized benchmark with specified solver

Note: We had found a small bug in the implementation that affected a couple of the benchmarks by generating duplicate grammar rules and we fixed it. However, that grammar caused slightly different number for the following benchmark
parity_not now is optimized in the first run.
